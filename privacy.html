                        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
                        <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how our application ("we," "us," or "the Service") handles information. By using the Service, you agree to the terms outlined herein. We prioritize user pseudonymity and data minimization.</p>

                        <h2>2. Data Minimization &amp; Collection</h2>
                        <p>We are committed to absolute privacy. The Service does NOT collect or store:</p>
                        <p>Legal Names or Physical Addresses<br>Email Addresses or Phone Numbers<br>Biometric Data or Government IDs<br>Precise Geolocation Data</p>
                        <p>The only data required for account creation is a unique Username and a hashed Password. This information is used solely for authentication purposes.</p>

                        <h2>3. User-Generated Content</h2>
                        <p>Any content you voluntarily share—including posts, comments, images, or profile metadata—is public by design. While we offer "anonymous" posting options, this merely removes the public link to your username; it does not change the nature of the data stored in our database. You are solely responsible for the content you upload and any consequences resulting from its publication.</p>

                        <h2>4. Third-Party Services &amp; Data Sharing</h2>

You may opt out of personalized ads via device settings.<br>Push Notifications (Expo): Delivers notifications if you opt in.</p>
                        <p>These providers are contractually bound to protect your data and may not use it for purposes other than providing their services to us. We do not sell your data to third parties.</p>

                        <h2>5. Data Security &amp; 'Recovery Codes'</h2>
                        <p>Passwords are cryptographically hashed using standard protocols. We cannot recover forgotten passwords. It is your exclusive responsibility to manage your credentials and secure your Recovery Codes. Loss of these credentials may result in permanent loss of access to your account and associated data.</p>

                        <h2>6. Service Provision 'As-Is'</h2>
                        <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, express or implied, regarding the reliability, availability, or accuracy of the Service. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate any aspect of the Service at any time without prior notice or liability.</p>

                        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
