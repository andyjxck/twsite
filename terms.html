6.3. Reporting. Users can report objectionable content via the report function. All reports are reviewed within 24 hours. False or malicious reporting may result in action against the reporter.

7.3. Message Retention. Messages are automatically hidden from view after 24 hours and permanently deleted after 7 days, unless "kept" by participants. Users can choose to "keep" messages, which prevents automatic deletion until all participants "unkeep" the message.

7.5. Chat Requests. Messages from non-friends appear as "chat requests" that must be accepted before a conversation begins. You can decline requests from users you don't wish to communicate with.
